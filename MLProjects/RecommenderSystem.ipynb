    "        - We can assign a values between -1 and 1 to users for interest in certain movies, -1 means the most interest 1 means the least, and we can do the same for movies\n",
    "          -1 means it's more of a certain interest of the user and 1 means it's not in the interest of the user\n",
    "        - In this example we hand-engineered the one-dimensional embeddings, in practice, these embeddings are much higher in dimensions, but we learn these embeddings automatically. \n",
    "          that's the beauty of collborative filtering models. \n",
    "        -  U is the user embeddings and V is the product embeddngs, the product of these 2 is A, which is a predictive feedback matrix.\n",
    "        - Our optimization objectie is to minimize the summation of the squared difference between the feedback labels and the predicted feedback\n",
    "        - We can solve this using SGD or Weighted Alternative Least Squares (WALS), WALS is specific to this problem\n",
    "        - The idea of WALS is that for each iteration we alternate between fix U and solve for V, and then fixing V and solving for U. \n",
    "        - WALS usually converges much faster than SGD, but SGD is more flexible with other loss functions\n",
    "        - We have only talked about observed items, but we still have the un-observed ones\n"
